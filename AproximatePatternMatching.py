# Approximate Pattern Matching Problem:
# Find all approximate occurrences of a pattern in a string. See PatternMatchingGenome.py

# Input: Strings Pattern and Text along with an integer d which is the HammimgDistance between Pattern and Pattern'
#â€ƒOutput: All starting positions where Pattern appears as a substring of Genome with at most d mismatches. (A list of positions)
